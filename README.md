# pi-open-tui

**English** | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

A locally maintained variant of [pi-open-tui](https://github.com/OldSuns/pi-open-tui) for the [Pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent. It keeps the upstream interface while defaulting working-state updates to a scroll-stable, event-driven mode.

## Highlights

- **Pi header** with model, thinking level, working directory, and useful slash-command hints
- **Responsive footer** with Git state, detected runtime, context usage, token counts, cost, and extension status
- **Framed editor** with block, bar, and underline cursor styles
- **Project awareness** for 50+ runtimes and detailed Git states, including ahead/behind, staged, modified, untracked, stashed, and detached HEAD
- **Turn telemetry** for TPS, time to first token (TTFT), duration, stalls, tokens, and list-price rate
- **Thinking peek**: an inline ticker replaces Pi's hidden `Thinking...` label with the tail of the model's reasoning while it works
- **Interactive settings** through `/open-tui`, available in English and Simplified Chinese
- **Version-guarded Pi compatibility shim**: fullscreen wheel speed falls back to Pi's default if its runtime support changes

## Requirements

- Pi 0.80 or later
- A terminal with UTF-8 and color support
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for the full icon set (optional; ASCII icons are built in)

## Install

Install from npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-open-tui-fixed
```

Or install straight from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/doccker/pi-open-tui-fixed
```

Or try it for one session:

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-open-tui-fixed
```

Do not load this variant and the upstream npm package together because both register `/open-tui` and replace the same UI components.

## Font and icons

Download any patched font from the official [Nerd Fonts downloads page](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) or [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest). Install it, select that font in your terminal profile, and restart the terminal.

The default `auto` mode detects the terminal environment, not the installed font file. If icons appear as boxes or incorrect symbols, open `/open-tui` and choose one of these modes under **Appearance**:

- `nerd`: force Nerd Font icons after configuring a Nerd Font in the terminal
- `ascii`: use plain-text icons with no patched font required
- `auto`: use Nerd Font icons in recognized terminals and ASCII elsewhere

If the font is installed but `auto` still selects ASCII, choose `nerd` explicitly. In VS Code, Windows Terminal, and similar apps, configure the font in the terminal profile rather than only installing it in the operating system.

## Configuration

Run `/open-tui` to open the settings dialog. It provides **General**, **Appearance**, **Footer**, and **Telemetry** tabs. Settings are stored in `~/.pi/agent/open-tui.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "settingsLanguage": "en",
  "cursorStyle": "block",
  "fullscreen": {
    "wheelScrollLines": 4
  },
  "icons": {
    "mode": "auto"
  },
  "footerSegments": {
    "cwd": true,
    "hostname": false,
    "sessionName": false,
    "gitBranch": true,
    "gitStatus": true,
    "gitCommit": false,
    "runtime": true,
    "context": true,
    "tokens": true,
    "cost": true,
    "extensionStatuses": true
  },
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tps": true,
    "ttft": true,
    "duration": true,
    "tokens": true,
    "stalls": true,
    "cost": true
  },
  "thinkingPeek": {
    "lines": 1
  },
  "workingRefresh": {
    "mode": "event"
  }
}
```

Key options:

| Option | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settingsLanguage` | `en`, `zh` | Changes the `/open-tui` interface language |
| `cursorStyle` | `block`, `bar`, `underline` | `bar` and `underline` require terminal cursor-shape support |
| `fullscreen.wheelScrollLines` | `1`-`10` | Lines scrolled per mouse-wheel notch in fullscreen mode; defaults to `4`. In `/open-tui`, press Enter on this item and type a number (values are clamped to `1`-`10`) |
| `icons.mode` | `auto`, `nerd`, `ascii` | Controls footer and telemetry icons |
| `footerSegments` | Boolean flags | Shows or hides individual footer data |
| `telemetry` | Boolean flags | Enables telemetry and its individual measurements |
| `thinkingPeek.lines` | `0`, `1`, `2` | Off, one-line, or two-line hidden thinking preview |
| `workingRefresh.mode` | `event`, `realtime` | Footer refresh strategy while the agent works; defaults to scroll-stable `event` mode |

`sessionName` appears only when the session has a name. `hostname` shows the short host name (first label of the machine's host name, e.g. `mba` from `mba.example.com`) with a server icon. `gitCommit` shows the short hash and tag in detached HEAD state. Disabling `extensionStatuses` hides the entire extension status line, including MCP status.

Fullscreen wheel speed uses an isolated compatibility shim for Pi 0.84.2's runtime field because Pi does not yet expose a public setter. On Pi versions without a compatible field, the setting is ignored and Pi's default scrolling remains active.

### Working refresh

`event` mode refreshes the footer at agent and message lifecycle boundaries without running the upstream 250 ms timer. This prevents periodic footer redraws from disrupting macOS Terminal scrollback while the model is working. Elapsed time is still calculated from timestamps and the final duration remains accurate, but the visible counter may pause between events.

`realtime` mode restores the upstream 250 ms periodic refresh. Use it only in terminals where active scrollback remains stable.

## Turn telemetry

After each complete agent run, pi-open-tui shows one transient result. Tool-call turns are combined into that result:

```text
> TPS 42.5 tok/s | ~ TTFT 1.2s | + 29.7s | ↑ 567 | ↓ 1.2k | ! stall 1x / 4.3s | $ $3.60/M
```

TPS is calculated from all provider-reported assistant output tokens divided by the total generation time across the run. Timing starts at `turn_start` and ends at the assistant `message_end`, so it includes TTFT, hidden reasoning, buffering, and stalls; tool execution between turns is excluded. Runs without output tokens or measurable generation time show `TPS —`.

The `$ / M` value is the model's list-price rate from `usage.cost.total`, not the cumulative session cost shown in the footer. Every telemetry field can be toggled from the **Telemetry** tab.

## Thinking peek

When Pi's **Hide thinking** setting is enabled, pi-open-tui shows a compact ticker in the native hidden thinking block's `Thinking...` position. The `/open-tui` setting offers three modes: **Off**, **1 line**, and **2 lines**.

- while the model is reasoning, the current thinking tail streams by with a spinner (`~ think ⠋ …`);
- when the answer starts, it settles on a check mark (`~ think ✓`);
- in 2-line mode, the previous and latest thinking lines share the same text indentation; if the latest line overflows, both rows follow its newest tail as tokens arrive instead of retaining the previous line;
- after the task settles, the native `Thinking...` label is restored.

```text
~ think ⠋ previous thought
          latest thought
```

The ticker appears only once the model actually streams reasoning, so non-reasoning models never show it. Pi's own Hide thinking toggle controls visibility; changing it takes effect immediately. Each row is truncated by *visible* width, so CJK-wide thinking text cannot overflow. Configure it from **General → Thinking peek** in `/open-tui`, or via `thinkingPeek.lines` in `open-tui.json`.

## Local development

npm test
npm run typecheck
pi -e .

## Acknowledgements

This project builds on several Pi community packages:

- **[pi-haiku](https://github.com/nnocte/pi-haiku)** — two-line footer structure and working timer
- **[pi-claude-code-tui](https://github.com/Phoobobo/pi-claude-code-tui)** — Pi logo frames and rounded editor border technique
- **[pi-zentui](https://github.com/lmilojevicc/pi-zentui)** — Starship-style footer segments, runtime detection, session lifecycle, and settings UI pattern
- **[pi-tps](https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-tps)** — turn timing, stall detection, and conservative TPS measurement

The logo frames are derived from Pi's official install script (`pi.dev/install.sh`). Runtime detection and Git porcelain parsing borrow structure from `pi-zentui`.
